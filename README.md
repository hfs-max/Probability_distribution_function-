# Probability Distribuation Function
The probability of an event occurring is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

## Types
It has two main types: 
1. Probability mass function (PMF)
2. Probability density function (PDF)

## 1. Probability mass function (PMF)
It deals only with the discrete random variables. (P(X=x) 
1. Tossing a coin
2. Rolling a dice 
3. Rolling consective dices 

## Commulative distribuation function with PDF 
This function deals with the probability of each possible outcome of rolling two dice, as well as the cumulative probability of outcomes less than or equal to each sum.
P(X<=x).
